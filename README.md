# Algorithms-And-Complexity-project-using-C#-

In the Algorithms and Complexity Project, I was required to create a Software Application for a Community Library to Manage Its Movie DVDs using C# Programming Language.
The project contains 6 classes which are:
Menu, Member, Movie, MemeberCollection, MovieCollection, TreeNode Classes
I did need to use Binary search Tree, ArrayList and object from another class.
Note:
1.To make Staff login, you would need to use the username: staff and password today123
2.To make Member login: firstly, you would need to create username for the Member and then add LastName+FirstName (without any space) for username and 4 digit numbers for password.
